## Training file
The training file for 3 algorithms are displayed in [`Train_DDPG.ipynb`](/Train_DDPG.ipynb), [`Train_DQN.ipynb`](/Train_DQN.ipynb) and [`Train_PPO.ipynb`](/Train_PPO.ipynb).

## Demonstrate (test the trained agent) file
One can observe the trained agent's (after training with 1000 episodes) behavior with [`LoadModelNTest.ipynb`](/LoadModelNTest.ipynb)
